# 22PWBCS0913-WP-FALL2023
 a repository to track and store my web development journey.

I am currently working on my local sub branch . Sub branches are vey usefull as they allow us to test and review our code before implementing them in our final code . 

1)Master Branch : The main code containing branch in our repository is called as the master branch.
2)Feature Branch : The branch which we use to introduce some big changes or features to our code   
                is called as the feature branch . We introduce and test our features seperately from the main branch ,so as not to introduce bugs into our main code or to cause any crashes.
3)Hot Fix Branch : A short lived branch used to fix bugs in the main code.

code : git checkout name // to jump to next branch
code : git checkout -b new_name  // to jump to and create new branch.
